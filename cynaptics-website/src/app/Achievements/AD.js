Each question and paragraph is associated with a specific theme. This  could be “Sports”, “English” or “Mathematics” etc. A question of a theme can be  answered by one of the paragraphs in that theme Task 2 For the given questions, also predict the exact answer from the  predicted paragraph. Predict the start_index and the answer_text field for the  given question. Note: Both the tasks will be marked individually.
